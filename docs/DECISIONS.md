# Decisions

One ruling per entry, append-only.\
A ruling is never edited; a later one supersedes it and says so.

Rulings that shape this component together with others are held in zorg's `docs/DECISIONS.md`, and cited here as "zorg's `Dn`".

---

## D1 - The component stands in its own repository

**Ruled by:** the director, 2026-10-09 (zorg's `D16`).\
**Affects:** this repository.

**Ruling.**\
This component was split out of zorg with the history of its vision and contract, and is private until its first working code.\
Its vision was ratified by zorg's `D5`, and its contract of record is `CONTRACT.md` (zorg's `D17`).

**Why.**\
Each component holds its own boundary and its own history from the start, as zorg's `D10` intends.

## D2 - A refusal proves one attempt, not the invocation

**Ruled by:** the director, 2026-10-09.\
**Affects:** `VISION.md` (*How it ended*, *Not a retrier*), `CONTRACT.md` (`not-delivered-signal`).

**Ruling.**\
"Not delivered" says that the delivery beneath refused this attempt outright, so it had no effect.\
It proves nothing about an earlier attempt of the same invocation: if that one ended unknown, its uncertainty stands, and whether repeating is safe is for whatever owns the effect to decide.

**Why.**\
AGP found that the earlier wording - "so repeating it is safe" - overreached: one attempt can end unknown, having taken effect, and a later attempt of the same invocation can then be refused outright (AGP's `D31`, and its handoff case 5).\
This is the first amendment of the ratified vision; it narrows a promise to what can be kept, and changes no direction.

**Alternatives weighed.**\
Correcting only the contract, leaving the vision promising what the contract denies; deferring until the component is built.

## D3 - Renamed operation-call

**Ruled by:** the director, 2026-10-09 (zorg's `D18`).\
**Affects:** this repository, its package, `VISION.md`, `CONTRACT.md` and `README.md`.

**Ruling.**\
The component formerly named opcall is named operation-call, in hyphenated whole words like every other name in the workspace; its repository is `apnex/operation-call`, and GitHub redirects the old name.\
Earlier entries keep the name they were written with.

## D4 - The first release, 0.1.0, carrying the five shared fixes

**Ruled by:** the director, 2026-11-10 (draw's `H31-5`, on zorg's agreement: draw's request, `upstream/drawv2-shared-component-fixes-request.md`, and zorg's reply, `upstream/drawv2-shared-component-fixes-reply.md`, whose answers bind).\
**Affects:** `package.json` and its lockfile, `.nvmrc`, `.github/workflows/gate.yml` and `release.yml`, `tools/consumer-test.mjs`, `CONTRACT.md`'s frontmatter and Reference, and `README.md`; nothing in `src/`, and nothing the component does.

**Ruling.**\
The five fixes every consumer of the components zorg maintains needs, made by draw's builders on zorg's agreement, none changing what the component does:
1. A release in the pinned-file form, gated by CI: `gate.yml` runs `npm test` and `npm run docs:check` on every push and pull request on Node 22 and 24, then the consumer test on Node 22 -- the package packed, installed into an empty project with `--omit=dev`, no AGP package installed, and every export imported by name; `release.yml`, on a tag `v<version>` that the repository's `release tags` ruleset protects, runs the gate, packs the package once, attaches the `.tgz` and its `.sha512` to a draft GitHub release, downloads both back and compares them, and only then publishes, immutable releases being enabled for the repository before its first tag; the first release is `0.1.0`.
2. A Node 22 floor: `engines` `>=22`, and `.nvmrc` `22`.
3. Dependencies between components as release files: `@apnex/shape-check`, and the tests' `@apnex/entity-store`, from `file:` links to the `0.1.0` release files, each pinned in the lockfile by its integrity.
4. AGP declared as what it is: `@agp/node` moved from `dependencies` to `devDependencies`, beside `@agp/core` and `@agp/transport-loopback`, each still a `file:` link to an AGP checkout, since every import of AGP in `src/` is a type.
5. The contract's frontmatter brought to mission-kit's: `id: C5`, `status: active`, and the sentences that said the id was unminted and the repository private until its first working code restated.

**Choices made at build.**
- `private: true` stays: it stops publishing to the npm registry, and `npm pack` packs the package with it.
- The style rules `npm run docs:check` holds are vendored in `tools/`, so CI fetches no mission-kit checkout.
- In CI this repository is checked out into a folder of its own and `apnex/agp` beside it, both inside the workspace, since `actions/checkout` places a repository only there; AGP is checked out with its history and then at `b179b4f` by that short id, so no full commit id is written but the actions' own pins, and built with `npm --prefix ../agp ci && npm --prefix ../agp run build` before `npm ci`, so the `file:` links to `../agp/packages` resolve (zorg's answer 3).
- Its contract claims no browser runtime, so the consumer test imports the package in Node alone, loading nothing in Chrome.

**Why.**\
Draw takes components as public GitHub release files pinned by hash and runs Node 22 in production (draw's `H26-2`); a `file:` link builds only beside a checkout, and an AGP declared for install would make every consumer install it though every import of it is a type.
